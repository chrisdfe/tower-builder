- Rooms aren't combining correctly anymore
- Figure out why residents stay in one spot for a while when traveling
- Residents don't seem to be interacting with furniture properly right now
- Ladders aren't tiling properly
- Room connections don't work reliably (probably because of room blocks)
- Inspect highlight doesn't stay after user mouses out
- Rooms + vehicles still don't get destroyed properly
- Sometimes room entrances don't get deleted
- Clicking on buttons in the UI also clicks on what ever is behind it, e.g. vehicle a room when you meant to click on the button
