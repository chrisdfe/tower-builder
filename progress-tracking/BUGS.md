# Bugs

## Current

- Sometimes room entrances don't get deleted  
- Clicking on buttons in the UI also clicks on what ever is behind it, e.g. building a room when you meant to click on the button
- Individual roomCells should know if they are valid again (right now it's just the room)
- Fix that NullReferenceArea in MapManager that shows up when defocusing/refocusing on the window again
- RoomEntrances in the blueprint room aren't getting highlighted
- Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0) does not work consistently on macos
- UI is way too big on my laptop
