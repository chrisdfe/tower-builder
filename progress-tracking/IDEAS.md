# Ideas

## General

- Medieval music but with weird synths - disco project/katamari
- Gahan wilson's the ultimate haunted house style
  - intentional dark/flourescent color palette
  - bizarre sound effects palette
- slopes/diagonal walls of arbitrary heights (1 wide by 4 high, 1x3, 1x1, etc)
- "coverings" - carpet, wallpaper, other decorative stuff
- Front wall segments to give more of a feeling of peering through into a building
- Change to perspective with a really high (or low?) FOV
- Turrets
  - manned and auto turrets
- Crops
  - different benefits from different types of plant
  - you can grow plants that give you stuff other than food
- long series of glowy patterned lights, star wars style
- little vehicles with only room for 1 resident
  - swoop bike
  - buggy
  - comfort and energy go down slower
- star wars pew pew laser volleys that get quicker and quicker as the vehicles get closer (like in star tours)
- ability to customize Tileability strategy for x/floor seperately
  - caps (static corners/ends)
  - repeat-block
  - a stretchy middle that is just a repeating block of 1
- Idea for organizing entities:
  - Atoms (lights, furniture)
  - Molecules (groups of atoms - rooms, etc)
  - Cells (groups of molecules - vehicles, buildings)
- Finding broken things in the countryside + breaking them down for scrap (at a piece of furniture)
  - they take up cargo space until they're broken down
- cozy and warm inside glow, cold and forboding exterior
- star wars laser guns. pew pew
- headlights
- optional exterior walls - without them your vehicle looks bare and industrial, like a star wars/eve online spaceship
- more resizable entity configuration - "caps" (corners that are static sizes) and "extendible parts" (bits that repeat to fill up the SelectionBox shape)
- Upgrades to exterior or wheels need to be done at a mechanic
- 3 layers - main, lower, and absolute bottom (wheel areas)
- warm fire orange with a neutral grey/blue shadow to accentuate the warmth of the light
- The feeling of going on a journey
  - A home base that you gradually build up, along with vehciles that you can send on excursions that you can improve along the way - the resources you gather during this journey can contriute torwards your overall coloy resources
- Vehicles that fit inside of other vehicles and vice versa
- An exterior shape that doesn't conform to the tile system
- 'front hallway' that stairs/escalators live in; front hallway doors
- right click dropdown contextual menu
  - generic "dropdown" component
- "dirty sci-fi"
  - borderlands 3
  - warhammer
  - jedi fallen order (beginning)
- ability to skew certain types of rooms?
- battle formation of vehicles - side-by-side, single file, etc
- with multiple vehicles all vehicles need to be piloted at the same time to go/stop. when one of them stops they are all signalled to stop
- Electrical plugs? for furniture to plug into?
- Residents can join your convoy and walk along side of the vehicle if you don't have enough beds.
  - They sleep outside in tents?
- Lots of non-player vehicles:
  - merchants
  - random passers-by
  - mercenaries
  - all of these you can attack if you want
- New state slices:
  - weather
  - temperature
  - freight/cargo
  - passengers/passenger seat
- this game loop:
  - Vehicles (moving vehicles) need fuel
  - You need scrap (currency) to buy fuel
  - You get scrap by traveling and looting/farming/gathering
  - You also need residents using the "engine" furniture
- Periodic supplies delivery? big old quarry trucks, helicopers, pack mule, etc

## Optimization Ideas

- Cache entity.cellCoordinatesList - it only needs to be recalculated when cells get set, not whenever when get
- CellCoordinatesList - a lot of getters that should be cached
- Entity/entityGroup getters
- CellCoordinatesList could use a lookup table instead of "Find" everywhere?
