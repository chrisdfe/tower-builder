# TODO

## Tasks

- Destroying room blocks seems to be broken again
- Placeable windows - new state slice/entity type
- New tool for merging/splitting up rooms
- Procedurally generated background that scrolls by
- Switch UI/State.SetEntityList to use a list of entities from Entities/State
- I don't think these static Create() functions on GameWorldRoom etc are used anymore
- Freight contents
- For a first draft, every 1 mile of journey a random passer-by shows up
  - after that, then encounters with other vehicles
- show/hide different entity layers/types
- UI elements to manage/interact with different entity layers/types
  - e.g lights: "turn all/selected lights off/on" toggle and "set all/selected light colors" button
- 'tileability strategy' or something - I can foresee needing 2 different types of tileability:
  - corners or 'caps' (left hand side or right hand side) of a fixed size, with 'middle' sections of a variable size (e.g what I'm currently doing for rooms etc)
  - just repeat the block template over and over again to fill up the selection box (e.g 2x2, 1x2) (e.g large wheels)
- light entity
- windows entity
- Reconsider whether entity key types (e.g Room.Key) are worth it in their current state
  - they could be stored as a string on the entitites themselves but remain as an enum to help with the unity editor
  - i.e in the code using an enum doesn't help much, but it does help in making sure you're connecting to the right thing in assetList
- pull Wheel.skinKey up into Entity/EntityDefinition
- maybe walls + ceiling should be the same entity as it is now
- Finish up route finder algorithm
  - Make sure each cell between current + target cells have enough vertical clearance
- Different types of transportation items should be able to occupy the same cell (escalators + doorways etc)
- Route parameters - routes
  - This would enable freight to require a large enough door for the freight to fit into
  - Also potentially allow for residents of different sizes
- Doors of different heights
- ability to save/load different chunks of the game world to a file
  - day time atmosphere effects
  - vehicles
- a hard-to-follow series of entity add/deletes happens after builtToolState.EndBuild happens - the entity is built and then the selection box in UI/state is reset and buildToolState calls ResetBlueprintEntity and removes/adds a new entity. Ideally this only happens as many times as it needs to, there's some redundancy it seems like.
- chassis that can expand vertically really high without needing support but can't support anything above it
  - tent, for freight
  - spectrum between this (can only expand 1 high) and be able to have lots of weight
  - also cheap/vs expensive (tent = cheap)
- Validate entity is not overlapping another entity in the same cell(s)
  - also cells in the same "overlapGroup" or whatever (freight and furntiure);
- 'unconstrained' vs 'constrained' selection box - tile/based vs mouse position coordinates
- Build ToolStateButtons dynamically from available states
- Make vehicles an entity again - I want to be able to place vehicles + have vehicle definitions
- "CursorManager" parent class to manage whether selection box is shown vs regular cursor, etc
- I should probably switch back to the raycast method of determining which entities are being moused over
- Decouple entity keys with the mesh they use - use "skinKey" like roomcell
- Clean up final gross entity type switch statements
  - FindDefinitionByKeyLabel
  - Entity.CreateFromDefinition
  - Entity.GetEntityDefinitionLabel
- AssetManager classes (FurnitureAssetManager etc) should derive from a base class
- Delete Scratchboard transform
- Stairs transportation item
- Transportation item capacity - residents queue up when it's at capacity
- Clean up UI padding/spacing, right now it's pretty inconsistent
  - Panel should be a prefab
- Room should just be a collection of walls/floor, in a similar way relationship to vehicles -> rooms
- Pull resident.SetResidentPosition out into Entity as a starting point for moving entities instead of just destroying/creating new ones
- Make cells 1x1.5 or 1x2 as in my sketchbook - floors/ceilings/walls are part of the Inside of box
- TransportationItemDefinition/entranceExitBuilder should probably return 2 lists (1 for entrances and 2 for exits) instead of entrance/exit tuples of single coordinates
- BuildValidators/DestroyValidators?
- EntityStateSlice build should fire onItemsBuilt event as well - currently it's just singular
- same as with how I made an entities appState slice:
  - Attributes appState slice group
  - Behaviors appState slice group
  - Validators appState slice group
- in build mode somewhere in the UI it should give you a list of all the validation rules about the current selected entity
- entity layers (determines the z-index the entity is rendered at)
- Furniture usage slots
- Break room entity down into:
  - Back walls entity
  - Side wall entity
  - light entity
  - Room would be a "group", making a room would be making a floor, back walls, etc simultaneously
- "Cell" class that encompasses coordinates, orientation?
- perhaps game should pause in build/destroy modes; can't switch back to play mode until everything is valid
- room templates should be a collection of furnitures, transportation items, etc.
  - possibly the user should be able to define room templates?
- MaterialReplacer:
  - should be able to replace arbirary materials with another
  - maybe should create a lookup table indexed by material name or something to avoid traversing gameObject tree too much?
- spiral staircase transportation
- Make rooms a collection of walls/back walls/windows/floors/lights. Some floors are 1 tile? floors vs platforms (like in teraria)
- "front door" transportation items - connection to the outside world
- Ability for residents to walk around on the ground
- When new resident slots open up (beds built) residents should arrive via ground, not just appear
- Stronger chassis should be able to have longer overhangs
- "Hunger" resident attribute
- SelectionBox should span the default size of transportation items instead of just the current cell
- Pull out a lot of the logic in these static Create() method
- UI element that displays current resident's goals
- "TickTimer" utility class
- new Route normalization algorithm should treat "UsingTransportationItem" segments differently
  - just go straight to the other side for now
  - maybe in the future some transportation items can be faster or slower than others
- bits of roomcell walls that light up when the room is highlighted
  - same thing with other entities
- Placeholder models for furniture items
- Animations when residents are traveling
  - Custom animations for when residents use specific furniture/transportation items
- Move a lot of the attributes in VehicleAttributesGroup into vehcile and rename VehcileAttributesGroup VehcileBehavior
- Resident goal priorities
- Resident -> ResidentAttributesWrapper -> ResidentBehaviors? or Resident -> ResidentBehaviors?
  - also for Furniture, Room, and Building
- Freight of different sizes - small, medium, large
  - small go on shelves
  - medium can stack on top of each other
  - large take up a whole cell?
  - larger = more $ obvs but more space/investment
- Different room "chassis" - tradeoff between structural integrety and light
  - more light = good for plants
  - more structural integrity = can build larger vehicles (good for freight? passengers?)
- Engines should yield less power as their condition goes down
- If a vehicle doesn't have any engines it shouldn't be able to move
- Make sure furniture isn't being used when a resident starts walking over there to use it
- I think validators will need to be state slices near trhe bottom of the tree now. Validators need to have access to a lot more than just the thing they're validating
  - same with Tempaltes/Definitions - they might need to be in their own namespace
- 'current selected vehicle' in UI state
- More cells - heavier; wheels can only manage a certain amount of weight (better wheels = can handle more weight)
- Modular way of applying materials to specific meshes
- Things you can do/specialize in with your vehicle:
  - be a bus (have passengers)
  - be an overnight bus (hotel rooms)
  - deliver things (freight room)
  - make food for your residents (farms)
- Camera that bypasses fog for build/destroy/inspection modes
- helpers for finding a cell off of the side of the left or right side of the screen, for spawning new residents, npc vehicles etc
- TransportationItem selectable entity
- Move entities when placing them instead of continually adding/removing them
- Template button should be visible when selecting a new entity type - right now it's just the category button
- Move RoomConnections into its own state slice
- maybe UI should be a sibling namespace to GameWorld instead of child
- Furniture should validate that there's not other furniture at the same coordinates
  - same with transportation items
- TransportationItem/Furniture that takes up multiple cells
- Fix the mesh scaling (everything is either 0.1 or 10 or 100 not 1)
- Some kind of way of making BedCreationWatcher not immediately add new residents - perhaps on a interval longer than every tick
- Moonlight/inside lights
- furniture z indexes
- destroy validation (cannot delete room with another room above it)
- tank treads wheels type
- proper room 'templates' prepopulated with furniture
  - bedroom
  - cockpit
- furniture that occupys different # of tiles
- dynamically rendered "Outer walls" of vehicle
- cellCoordinates.bottom row function - use in room cell overhang validator
- Connections to outside
  - RouteSegmentNode subtype for outside connections
  - RoomConnection subtype for outside connections
  - Wheels room should allow ladder furniture
  - Residents should be able to walk on the ground and climb up the wheels ladder
- furniture that requires floor/does not require floor
- consider putting RoomConnections in seperate state slice
- tick animations
  - eg resident going from one cell to the other
  - this probably means reorganizing things to calculate the next tick every tick (for the animation to know where to lerp from/to)
- Make residents 2 tiles tall 1 tile wide
- Vehicle connections
- Debug resident path/goal gameworld display things
- furniture interaction slots
  - direction (left, center, right)
- furniture z indexes - in front, behind
- Improved lighting
  - room lights that come on at night
- Reconsider how routes are constructed - maybe every segment should be 1 cell?
- Convert other List wrappers to use the new ListWrapper generic
- "reset" button to reset state to default
- ability to start game with a non-empty state already - load rooms, connections, residents, current time, etc
- RouteFinder shouldn't look for every room entrance in the room, just on the current floor - it should also look for furniture on the current floor that could transport the resident elsewhere
- Furniture "usage slots" - an array of residents currently using this piece of furniture the size of the furnitures occupancy
- Residents currently stay on the same cell for more than one cycle currently - because of repeating cellCoordinates in segment end/start
- Wallet transation history
  - Wallet "batch" transactions so the transactions don't get flooded with lots of tiny transactions (e.g. desk income)
    - transactions will get added to queue, grouped by string id/message, then OnTick() they get applied
- Room furniture
  - beds
  - desks
  - stairs??
  - elevator cars???
    - potentially furniture could replace "room modules"
      - rooms would just be generic rooms, and furniture would dictate the behavior/functionality
- "Schedules" store, possibly right below timestore? residents will have schedules, but potentially weather effects and other such things could use this schedule mechanic
- Route weighting mechanism to figure out which route is the best to take
  - probably as simple as fewer cells traveled > more cells traveled
- Keybindings for build, destroy, inspect, none
- 'closed' connections, e.g between 2 private rooms (e.g condo)
- Stairwells should not be able to be placed next to elevators or other stairwells
  - Perhaps this should be part of "Transportation category validation"
- Resizing rooms should also reset their entrances (e.g if an elevator had a connection but has been resized)
- Stop destroying/recreating roomCells whenever the cursor changes position - only when it needs resizing
- destroy validation
- rooms should not be able to be built in thin air above ground floor
- "Path" constants for paths used in Resource.Load - refactoring/moving things around would be easier
  if they're all in one place
- Z-index constants
- should the destroy tool replace the room with an empty floor, at least on floors 0 and above? otherwise, certain rooms would be undestroyable?

## Projects

- Store system
- Kitchen/restaurant room
- Top-level "KeyBindingsManager" that listens for user input + dispatches actions
- UI overlays
- Dynamic weather
- save/load

## Cleanup

- Switch the order of ListType and ItemType in ListItemStateSlice generic (ItemType should be first)
- Room datatypes/state is structured in a different way to some of the newer classes (e.g make it Room.SkinKey instead of RoomSkinKey)
- RouteFinder creates too many branches
- RoomCells -> RoomCellList OR RoomList -> Rooms
- FloorPlane is confusingly named - it is actually just the collider that watches for the current mouse position, not the floor
- ListWrapper should implememnt IEnumerable
- A "UI settings" object I can tweak a bunch of stuff in the unity editor with, instead of public serializable fields on each script?
- Awkward naming conflict between ToolState + tool sub states

## Ideas

- Idea for organizing entities:
  - Atoms (lights, furniture)
  - Molecules (groups of atoms - rooms, etc)
  - Cells (groups of molecules - vehicles, buildings)
- Finding broken things in the countryside + breaking them down for scrap (at a piece of furniture)
  - they take up cargo space until they're broken down
- cozy and warm inside glow, cold and forboding exterior
- star wars laser guns. pew pew
- headlights
- optional exterior walls - without them your vehicle looks bare and industrial, like a star wars/eve online spaceship
- more resizable entity configuration - "caps" (corners that are static sizes) and "extendible parts" (bits that repeat to fill up the SelectionBox shape)
- Upgrades to exterior or wheels need to be done at a mechanic
- 3 layers - main, lower, and absolute bottom (wheel areas)
- warm fire orange with a neutral grey/blue shadow to accentuate the warmth of the light
- The feeling of going on a journey
  - A home base that you gradually build up, along with vehciles that you can send on excursions that you can improve along the way - the resources you gather during this journey can contriute torwards your overall coloy resources
- Vehicles that fit inside of other vehicles and vice versa
- An exterior shape that doesn't conform to the tile system
- 'front hallway' that stairs/escalators live in; front hallway doors
- right click dropdown contextual menu
  - generic "dropdown" component
- "dirty sci-fi"
  - borderlands 3
  - warhammer
  - jedi fallen order (beginning)
- ability to skew certain types of rooms?
- battle formation of vehicles - side-by-side, single file, etc
- with multiple vehicles all vehicles need to be piloted at the same time to go/stop. when one of them stops they are all signalled to stop
- Electrical plugs? for furniture to plug into?
- Residents can join your convoy and walk along side of the vehicle if you don't have enough beds.
  - They sleep outside in tents?
- Lots of non-player vehicles:
  - merchants
  - random passers-by
  - mercenaries
  - all of these you can attack if you want
- New state slices:
  - weather
  - temperature
  - freight/cargo
  - passengers/passenger seat
- this game loop:
  - Vehicles (moving vehicles) need fuel
  - You need scrap (currency) to buy fuel
  - You get scrap by traveling and looting/farming/gathering
  - You also need residents using the "engine" furniture
- Periodic supplies delivery? big old quarry trucks, helicopers, pack mule, etc

# Done

- Maybe Floor should have a Room room field to simplify things
- starting a room selection inside another room should expand that room
- Transportation room furniture interface - have a "connects to"
  - Room entrances could be "Doorway" furniture instead
- "Journey" datatype - driving vehicle gets you closer to your destination
- Draggable/resizable transportation items
- Rooms aren't validating that they're on top of another room again
- GameWorldEntityList
- replace ValidateWheelsAreOnCorrectFloor with generic validator
- don't default to weird "none" room type
- "floors" - not all room cells should have floors by default
- system for items that can connect horizontally/vertically
  - a way of organizing/naming nodes in the mesh tree to do this automatically without configuration
- wheels should be their own entity instead of a room now
- Entities are staying "valid blueprint blue" after being built
- Beef up validations for different entity types
- Wheels should not have vertical flexibility
- get rid of Room.Skin + config for now (wheels entity renders it obsolete)
- GameWorldEntity
- GameWorldEntityList that manages:
  - setting colors responding to inspect/build/destroy state
  - Adding/destroying entity types when they are added/removed from the store
- Clean up final gross entity type switch statements
  - Entity.CreateFromDefinition
- Rooms are highlighted as "invalid" when they are multiple cells high, even though they are allowed to be built
- Floors should be taken into account in route finding
- Clicking "none" in the build tool state buttons crashes the game
- Add two way transportation items back in (right now doorways are one way)
- Bring back "is on top of another room" room validation
- Replace ground cells with a simpler ground for now
- Convert TILE_SIZE to a Vector2
- Rooms shouldn't be able to be x number of cells wider than wheel base
- Create "IEntity" interface to abstract some of this OnBuild/OnDestroy stuff
  - Same for things that are Setup/Teardown-able?
- reorganize/simplify buildtool state to be more dynamic
- Freight Entity
- Maybe entity needs to have a couple more generic parameters, like TemplateType and ValidatorType
- Rename "MeshWrapper" to "EntityMeshWrapper"
- GameWorldEntity
- change EntityDefinition.cellCoordinatesList to something else, it's easy to confuse with entity.cellCoordinatesList
- Destroy tool seems to be broken
- BuildToolState/BuildStateButtonsManager are a big mess with all these switch statements now
- abstract room validators up into EntityValidators
- ssame with room definitions/queries
- Maybe instead of roomCells room could use the entity cellCoordinatesList
- Definitions/Queries could probably be pulled out into a "EntityTemplateListQueries" class
- "Entities state slice"? is that getting too deep into inheritence
- Fix transportationitem tiling
- Rename "templates" to "definitions" & remove a lot of 'constant' fields from entity, like title, category, etc. A reference to its definition is good enough
- escalators should be able to be 3 tiles high/wide - right now it's just increments of 2
- transportation items should support multiple sets of entrances/exits
- TransportationItem meshes are broken again
- Tileable.cs probably has classes in there that need to be broken out
- auto generate entity buttons
- Fix room cell tiling
- abstract room/furniture validators -> entity validators
- Move the rest of the entities states (resident, transportationitems etc) into the entities state
- MaterialReplacer:
  - should be static
- Remove most of the current room templates - right now there should just be a single room type (empty)
- "Material replacer" that uses a lookup map to replace materials in fbx files with unity materials of the same name
- All state slices should add lists of items instead of singular - e.g AddRooms instead of AddRoom
- Figure out why 2 game world transportation items (1 cell for each cell in a transportation so 4 in total) are being created instead of 1
- "List" state slice
- Reorganize models/prefabs to create less of a delineation between the 2
- Sun quickly resets to beginning position at the start of every day
- Integrate tileable into TransportationItem
- Reorganize prefabs to be embedded in other prefabs/managers and get rid of the reliance on the Resources/ folder
- Remove residentmotor state
- Improved lighting
  - global sun light that rotates/changes color as the day progresses
- Use Invoke? syntax for delegates everywhere in state
- Resident "energy" attribute
  - Replenished by sleeping in a bed
- Delete map cell helpers
- TransportationItem meshes
- Make transportation item meshes show on every cell that they occupy.
- show a notification or something if no route is found for a residnet
- Animate resident traveling
- replace room entrances with TransportationItems
  - Remove room entrances
- Maybe get rid of the 3 different resident behavior state handlers - I'm not sure there are going to be more than 3 and they complicate interaction with the appstate
- turn this into a car game
- "watchers" that sit at the bottom of appstate and don't hold any state but react to/mutate other parts of appState?
  - e.g residents moving in watcher
- "VehicleAttributes" or "VehicleStats" - a slice lower down in the state tree to capture things like fuel level, total cells, current speed etc
- building "stats" or "attributes" - fuel, power level, current speed, etc.
  - uses queries from furniture/furniturebheviors/residents/residentbehaviors
- Replace AssetManager with putting more unity-centric AssetList field on prefabs
- Work through the room/furniture 'isInBlueprintMode' issue. They're not in sync right now
- "TransportationItem" + entities - escalators, stairs
  - I think I've determined these are functionally different from furniture enough that they are a whole different thing.
- function to calculate normalized progress between 2 times of day
- Furniture validation
- Resident validation
- Standardize around "Initialize/Deinitialize" or "Setup/Teardown"
- Resident furniture behaviors
  - furniture "controls" resident while they're using it
- consider putting vehicles state further down in the heirarchy - having vehicles be able to query their contents in various ways
  (e.g how many residents are currently inside of it, or whether it has a cockpit/engine) would be helpful
- Delete room entrances when a block gets deleted as well
- Ability to destroy a single block in a flexible room
- Move Rooms dictionary in Rooms state somewhere else & make it more extensible
- blueprint price indicator for flexible rooms
- Add GameWorldRoomList
- You should be able to delete a single block of a flexible-sized room
- Add residents
- namespace reorganization
  - Split "type definitions (Room, Route, Resident etc) into "Data" namespace
  - Rename "Stores" to "GameState" or something
- When casting the mouse ray, build a stack of interactable/inspectable elements
  - If that stack contains a ui element:
    - on mouse down don't propagate
    - on mouse up, still propagate but handle it further up the chain
  - Eventually this will allow for multiple clicks in the same location cycling through this list
- Add concept of different "vehicles" or separate entities - groups of rooms. When you add/delete a room it can either add to an existing vehicle or create a new one
- Blueprint should just be a room in RoomState - right now it lives in a seperate place in BuildToolState;
- Draggable destroy tool
- Move current RoomDefinitions constants to a field in Registry - with ability to split up the "registering room template" logic into different files
- Moving camera around with middle mouse button
- Camera zoom in/out
- Room addition is broken again
- Generate rooms buttons in RoomBlueprintButtonsManager dynamically
  - Room types in BuildToolPanel should be grouped by RoomCategory
- Flexible-sized rooms should remember the 'blocks' they are made up of, to avoid having to recalculate it when you destroy individual blocks.
- Blueprint validators should probably take in the entire Store object
- Rename RoomDetails to RoomTemplate
- Use factories for RoomValidator and RoomEntranceBuilder, right now all rooms of the same type share the same instance
- GetRoomPrice should live on Room, not Blueprint
- Debug resident walk along route to destination
- Perhaps Stores.Map.Rooms should just be Stores.Rooms and delete Stores.Map
  - Also rename "MapUI" to just "UI"
- RoomEntrances namespace?
- Make ground a cube, cut holes in it when you build a room
- RoomCellValidators that follow the same pattern as EntranceBuilders instead of what I have now
- resident pathfinding
- For debug purposes - draw line between cells, along route
- transport/rooms connected to transport system
- "RoomCellPosition" is confusing - change to "RoomCellOrientation"
- Having RoomUse, RoomCategory AND RoomModules seems like too much?
- Rename 'useDetails' to 'moduleDetails'
- for when I implement elevators: Elevator cars can go only from the top to the bottom - no stopping at inbetween places.
  - This helps rationalize having to build all those hallways and stairs
  - Perhaps "upgrades" that can make them stop at 1 other floor per upgrade?
- things are feeling kind of messy because roomCells are having to know way too much about their room - I should make things more unidirectional
- Removing rooms should also delete their room connections
- Add blueprint room connections to main room connections list in MapStore when the room gets built
- Elevator entrances should only be at the top and bottom - maybe get ElevatorModule to do this?
  - Similar thing with hallways and lobbies
- Mesh for rooms with left, middle, right etc. segment tiles
- Combining rooms seems to delete them right now
- GameWorldBlueprintCell should wrap GameWorldRoomCell just like blueprintCell -> roomCell does
- Room "Modules", to attach to rooms and give them behaviors. Like unity components
- Rename MapCursor/MapCursorCells to RoomBlueprintCursor/RoomBlueprintCursorCells
- Flexible-sized rooms should cost more per tile - right now they're still a flat cost liek Inflexible rooms
- Map/toolStateHandlers + UI/subState/ keeps confusing me
- Placing a tile next to another flexible room should add onto it instead of creating a new room. i.e for elevators/lobbies
- Flexible-sized rooms currently only work in increments of 1x1: make them work in increments of any rectangular room shape.
  - e.g I want to make a wide elevator that takes up 2 horizontal cells
- CellCoordinates validation stuff should go somewhere other than inside of RoomBlueprintCell
- RoomCell class (wrapps cellCoordinates)
- Inspect ToolState mode
- Buttons that show active state
- Destroy ToolState mode
- Add click-and-drag room vehicle
- Add flexble-sized rooms
- Remove 'RoomStore' - having just MapStore should be fine
  - Combine RoomTemplate and RoomTemplate
- Room-specific validations
  - Lobby should be allowed on certain floors only
  - Elevators should not be allowed within a certain distance to each other
